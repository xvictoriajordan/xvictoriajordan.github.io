### Research

I plan on duplicating Ryan Pickering's results while also focusing on related topics and queries to see if there is anything of interest there. In terms of timeline, I plan on looking at his original timeline of January 2004 until April 2015, May 2015 until the present and then January 2004 until the present. I will be looking at the topics and queries in particular to see if anything stands out, if there are any major changes etc. I will also look at regions following the same format as above and again looking at topics and queries. I will include both provinces and cities.

I will also be eliminating the sematics seciton. While I did think in his presentation it was useful, since I will be focusing on the related topics and queries (and just after doing a quick look through) the terms he found in his semantics section are in the trends and queries. Therefore I will devote a whole section on examing those since his original section on semantics will also be included. 

### Comapring Conclusions

One of the goals is to compare the conclusion I make with the one Pickering made. I think that by looking at the topics and queries it will strenghten both conclusions and maybe point out some trends that have occured since the creation of his project.
